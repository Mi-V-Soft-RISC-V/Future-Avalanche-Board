# Libero Projects
The Libero_Projects folder contains sample Mi-V Libero designs.

## Design Features
The Libero designs include the following features:
* A soft RISC-V processor
* A RISC-V debug block allowing on-target debug using SoftConsole
* The operating frequency of the design is 50MHz
* Target memory is RAM
* User peripherals (GPIO, Timers, UART)

## Target Hardware
Details of the Future Avalanche Board and it's features can be found:
* AVMPF300TS-01 (MPF300) [here](https://www.microsemi.com/existing-parts/parts/139680).

# FlashPro Express
The FlashPro_Express_Projects folder contains the pre-generated programming files, which can be downloaded directly to the target board using FlashPro Express.

# Design Tools
The following design tools are required.

## Libero SoC v12.4
Libero SoC is Microsemi's FPGA design software.
It is available from [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/libero-soc#downloads).

## FlashPro Express
FlashPro Express is Microsemi's Programming and debug tool. It is included in the Libero SoC software and is also
available as a standalone application found [here](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software). Please note, that if Libero SoC is already on your system, you do not need
the standalone version.

## SoftConsole
SoftConsole is Microsemi’s free software development environment facilitating the rapid development of bare-metal and RTOS based C/C++ software for Microsemi CPU and SoC based FPGAs. It provides development and debug support for all Microsemi SoC FPGAs and 32-bit soft IP CPUs. SoftConsole can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4879-softconsole).  

### SoftConsole Projects
A set of RISC-V example software projects are also available for these designs from the SoftConsole page.
